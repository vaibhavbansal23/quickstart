# Introduction 

This sample project covers:

1. Setting up ImageKit React SDK
2. Rendering images
3. Setting authentication context for the SDK
4. Applying common image manipulations
5. Adding overlays to images
6. Lazy loading images
7. Blurred image placeholder
8. Client-side file uploading

# How to run locally

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Head over to the link, choose your development OS and target OS and install its dependencies if not already done.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Setup authentication

In `app/config/Imagekit.js`, set the following parameters for authentication:

```js
const urlEndpoint = "<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT>";
const publicKey = "<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY>";
const authenticationEndpoint = "http://localhost:8080/auth";
```

Required parameters are `urlEndpoint` and `publicKey`. The `authenticationEndpoint` parameter is optional and only needed if you want to use the SDK for client-side file upload. 

You can get the value of [URL-endpoint](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#url-endpoints) from your ImageKit dashboard.
API public key can be obtained from the [developer](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#developers) section in your ImageKit dashboard.

### Start Metro Server:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

### Run the app in ios simulator (You need to have Xcode installed):

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Run the app in android simulator (You need to have Android Studio installed):

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## Setup dummy backend for upload

Move to the server directory
```shell
cd server
```

Create `.env` file by copying `sample.env`

```shell
cp sample.env .env
```

Set the following keys in `.env`

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY=private_XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

API private key can be obtained from the [developer](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#developers) section in your ImageKit dashboard.

Please note that file upload will only work if, along with the above, you have also defined `publicKey`, `urlEndpoint`, and `authenticationEndpoint` variables in `app/config/Imagekit.js`.

Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Node.js server

```
npm start
```

Node server will run at `http://localhost:8080`.
